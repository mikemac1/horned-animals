## Comments & Reflections Lab 1

- Created a react app using the npx create-react-app. Fairly straight-forward and it feels like I am unlearning how I set up the HTML portion of the app. Not hard but going slow as I tried to figure out what I was doing. I had two issues to overcome. The first was getting several warnings and errors that were attributed to not having React Dev Tools installed as a Chrome extension.  The second issue was my syntax was incorrect when passing the HornedBeast props from the Main component to HornedBeast. Sadly an easy fix that a TA had to point out but correctible.  Overall it took me 2.5 hours to complete this lab.

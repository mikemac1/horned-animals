## Comments & Reflections Lab 1

- Created a react app using the npx create-react-app. Fairly straight-forward and it feels like I am unlearning how I set up the HTML portion of the app. Not hard but going slow as I tried to figure out what I was doing. I had two issues to overcome. The first was getting several warnings and errors that were attributed to not having React Dev Tools installed as a Chrome extension.  The second issue was my syntax was incorrect when passing the HornedBeast props from the Main component to HornedBeast. Sadly an easy fix that a TA had to point out but correctible.  Overall it took me 2.5 hours to complete this lab.

- What went well, that I might forget if I don’t write down? Setting up React-Bootstrap, Netlify, and more importantly above all, creating the components that were used today. I really have no idea how any of the pages work together. For instance the default page line at the bottom, what is it doing? Why can there only be one line? What happens when you have functional components with class components? All of these questions and more are just piling up and I'm struggling at best with the basics.

- What did I learn today? Using Netlify is a very cool site to be able to host when running React versus Github Pages. I don't know why it supports React and Github doesn't but it is neat that there is a site that can host without charge.

- What should I do differently next time? Honestly I don't know. I put in less tickets today than yesterday but I completed watched the lecture again this afternoon and some parts 3 or 4 times because I am really not getting anything. I think at of all the questions asked today I might have been able to answer 2 of them. My knowledge is not where it needs to be and other than practicing I am not sure what else to do.

What still puzzles me, or what do I need to learn more about? LoL, everything. If the Class components stayed in just the syntax yesterday with just the HTML enclosed it would be a breeze, but as soon as the JS functions got included everything has been completely over my head. Top three of mind right now

- arrow functions
- class components
- basic JS fundamentals

- Is the assignment complete? If not, where exactly did you leave off, and what work remains? It is completed, barely, but completed.

## Comments & Reflections Lab 3

Number and name of feature: Feature #1 - Display a modal
Estimate of time needed to complete: 3 hours
Start time: 1:05pm
Finish time: 6:34pm
Actual time needed to complete: 5 hours

- What went well, that I might forget if I don’t write down? Ummmm, the fact that I can type what the T/As tell me to type. I really don't know how my site is working and couldn't walk you thru it if you asked me.

- What did I learn today? The one thing I learned today is that `this.props` means it came from a parent.

- What should I do differently next time? I honestly don't know. I immediately starting working on the lab because I was afraid of what was going to have to be accomplished and not knowing where to start. Honestly I still have the code challenge to do and after being up since before 4am, I will be lucky to get half of them done.

- What still puzzles me, or what do I need to learn more about? Again, everything. I don't know how state, setState, the difference between calling a function and just passing the function's name. I'm really at a loss. I'm surprised I haven't been asked to stop coming to class because I really don't get any of this.

- Is the assignment complete? If not, where exactly did you leave off, and what work remains? Yes it is complete only because of what the TAs (Justin, Matt, & Tammy) and Sheyna directed me to do.
